As a web developer, you can be faced with demand for presenting complex mathematical expressions on the websites you develop. *Mathematical Markup Language* (MathML), is a key tool that empowers you to seamlessly integrate mathematical notation into your websites, enhancing accessibility and functionality.

## What is MathML?

MathML is a markup language designed to encode mathematical content and display it on web pages. Developed by the [World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)](https://www.w3.org/Math/), MathML provides a standardized format for representing mathematical expressions, formulas, and equations, ensuring compatibility across different platforms and devices.

## Why MathML Matters?

MathML plays a vital role in making mathematical content accessible on the web. Prior to its introduction, displaying mathematical equations online was often cumbersome, relying on images or other workarounds that hindered accessibility and searchability. MathML revolutionizes this process by allowing developers to describe mathematical expressions in a structured and semantic way, making it easier for browsers and assistive technologies to interpret and render the content.

## How Does MathML Work?

MathML utilizes XML syntax to define mathematical structures. It consists of elements that represent various mathematical components such as numbers, operators, variables, and functions. These elements can be combined to create complex mathematical expressions. MathML is compatible with other web technologies such as HTML and CSS, enabling developers to integrate mathematical content seamlessly into their web pages.

## Getting Started with MathML

For web developers looking to incorporate MathML into their projects, getting started can be intimidating. This is why Structeezy provides a full set of MathML Elements, offering preconfigured Bricks elements and examples for using MathML to display mathematical content on you website.

To use MathML, you can simply include MathML element within your documents structure trees, utilizing Structeezy panel to insert tags such as `<math>`, `<mrow>`, `<msup>`, and `<mfrac>` to structure mathematical expressions. Additionally, CSS can be employed to style and enhance the appearance of MathML content, providing further customization options.
